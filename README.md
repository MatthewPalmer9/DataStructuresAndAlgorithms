# Data Structures & Algorithms

![Big O Cheatsheet](bigO_cheatsheet.png)

## Overview
This repository uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for the testing suite. Additionally, it follows the lessons outlined in [this free PDF on Data Structures and Algorithms](https://fktpm.ru/file/77-data-structures-and-algorithms-with-javascript.pdf). If that link does not work at some point in the future, the PDF file is also included in this repo just in case.

### Instructions for Running Tests
- Begin by cloning down this repository.
- Make sure to run `npm i` to install dependencies / `node_modules/`.
- Finally, run `npm test` to run the test suite.
